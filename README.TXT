Robot Class : CornerRobot

Step 1 - Create a World, which is an instance of the WorldOfRobot class.

Step 2 - You can use the addCornerRobot() method of the WorldofRobot's instance 
to add CornerRobot in the World or create it by using the CornerRobot class.
         
The Robot now appear in the World and on your screen.

Step 3 - To move the robot, you can use the moveSeveralTimes(int m) 
method from the WorldOfRobot's instance. You choose the number of moves 
by typing an integer number.

If u created the CornerRobot by using its class, you can also use the move()
method of the CornerRobot's instance, but the robot will only move once per
use.

Robots on the move, technology on the move ─=≡Σ((( つ◕ل͜◕)つ 

(BONUS)

Step 4  - If you want to try all the robots that we created, you 
can delete the actual world and create a new one.

Step 5 - Use the registerAllRobots() method from the WorldOfRobot's instance, 
all the robots will appear.

Step 6 - To move the robots, you can use the moveSeveralTimes(int m) 
method from the WorldOfRobot's instance. 

All the robots are dancing ! 


Together, we're stronger (-(-_-(-_(-_(-_-)_-)-_-)_-)_-)-)
